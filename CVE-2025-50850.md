## üß† Summary

The vendor login mechanism in CS-Cart 4.18.3 lacks basic protections against brute-force attacks. The endpoint allows unlimited login attempts without CAPTCHA, rate limiting, or account lockout mechanisms, making it trivial for attackers to perform credential guessing attacks.

---

## üìç Affected Component

- `vendor.php` (Vendor login endpoint)

---

## üö® Impact

- Enables attackers to systematically brute-force vendor credentials.
- May result in unauthorized access to vendor accounts.
- Can lead to data leakage, financial loss, or further compromise of the platform.

---

## üì¶ Proof of Concept (PoC)

PoC has been **withheld** to avoid public misuse.  
It may be disclosed:
- Upon responsible request, or
- After CS-Cart implements appropriate security controls.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation

- Implement CAPTCHA (e.g., reCAPTCHA) on vendor login forms.
- Introduce account lockout thresholds or temporary delays after failed login attempts.
- Monitor for abnormal login activity and brute-force patterns.
