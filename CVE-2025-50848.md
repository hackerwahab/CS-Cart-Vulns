## 🧠 Summary

CS-Cart 4.18.3 allows vendors to upload `.html` files through the File Manager, which are rendered directly in the browser. This enables an attacker to serve malicious content from a trusted domain, which can be used for phishing, data harvesting, or browser-based attacks.

---

## 📍 Affected Component

- `vendor.php` → File Manager upload functionality

---

## 🚨 Impact

- Allows attacker to host and render malicious HTML pages.
- May lead to phishing attacks, credential theft, or session manipulation.
- Trusted-domain hosting increases the chance of successful exploitation.

---

## 📦 Proof of Concept (PoC)

Technical details and exploitation steps are **withheld** to prevent misuse.  
A PoC will be shared:
- Upon responsible request, or
- After a vendor patch is released.

---

## 🛡️ Mitigation

- Block `.html` and similar extensions at upload level.
- Enforce MIME/type checks server-side.
- Use `Content-Disposition: attachment` headers to force file downloads.
- Consider sandboxing or quarantining user-uploaded content.
