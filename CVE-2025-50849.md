## 🧠 Summary

CS-Cart 4.18.3 contains an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the vendor sticker management functionality. The endpoint for enabling or disabling stickers accepts a `company_id` parameter without verifying if the user is authorized to perform the action on the specified company.

## 📍 Affected Component

vendor.php?dispatch=ab__stickers.change_vendor_status&sticker_id=46&company_id=16&result_ids=content_ab__stickers&status=A

## 🚨 Impact

- Any authenticated vendor or lower-privileged user can alter sticker status for other vendors.
- Leads to unauthorized actions affecting other vendors' settings or branding.
- Can be combined with enumeration or business logic flaws for larger impact.

## 📦 Proof of Concept (PoC)

The technical PoC is **withheld** to prevent exploitation.  
It will be provided:

- After the vendor has released a fix.

## 🛡️ Mitigation

- Implement proper access control on sensitive endpoints.
- Validate ownership of `company_id` server-side before processing any change.
- Do not rely on client-side filtering for authorization decisions.
